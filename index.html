          <li>Pictured is an Oophaga Pumilo “Strawberry Blue Jeans.” </li>
          <li>I’m going to convince you to at least consider the idea of keeping dart frogs in bioactive vivariums, because you’re stressed. At the end of the day, sometimes you need a little nature in your life. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Have you ever wanted a fish tank, but thought it was too expensive or too much work? Do you struggle to keep house plants alive? Considering a vacation to a tropical locale to escape HTML 5 and explaining GitHub to people like me? I propose that an easy, relatively inexpensive, and ultimately very rewarding option is the keeping of poison dart frogs. Don’t worry, they aren’t poisonous in captivity. That famous toxin is derived from their wild diet. </p>

        <p>One of the best parts of caring for these colorful little amphibians is their housing. Dart frogs require humid environments and benefit tremendously from the inclusion of live plants in the enclosure. Not only does this benefit the frogs, but it is aesthetically breathtaking. You have free license to create a real slice of the jungle in your living room. Not only does it look awesome, but it is nearly entirely self-sustaining. Including a “clean up crew” consisting of isopods and springtails handle nearly all the heavy lifting, all you need to do is feed the frogs, mist the enclosure, and occasionally trim back the plants. This is far simpler than nearly any aquarium setup, and you don’t need powerful lighting or tedious filtration to pull it off. </p>

  Focusing again on the frogs themselves, the animals are very small. The largest of commonly kept dart frogs only reaches a length of 2”. They are highly varied in color, pattern, personality, and availability, but they can all be kept in roughly the same conditions. Even within a single species like Dendrobates tinctorius, the range of coloration is mind blowing, and depends on the exact location they where originally collected from in the wild.

  <p>The point of this brochure is to share an interest of mine, hopefully without coming off as that creepy frog guy. I’m open to any questions about them; I believe the exchange of knowledge should always be a two way street. </p>
